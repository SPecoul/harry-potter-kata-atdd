Harry Potter kata: ATDD example
=

This is an implementation of the [Harry Potter kata](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataPotter).

With this implementation of the kata I used Acceptance Test Driven Development to 
drive the functionality. I share this implementation to complement my blog post on 
ATDD: [http://blog.thesoftwarecraft.com/2014/01/acceptance-test-driven-development.html](http://blog.thesoftwarecraft.com/2014/01/acceptance-test-driven-development.html).
